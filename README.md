Linear Regression Hand On 
The  dataset containing various demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors, along with healthcare-related information such as claim amounts, past consultations, and hospital expenditures.

Problem Statement: Predicting healthcare charges or insurance premiums for individuals based on their demographic, lifestyle, and medical attributes.

Features (X):

age
sex
bmi (Body Mass Index)
children
smoker (smoking status)
past_consultations (number of past medical consultations)
num_of_steps (number of steps taken by the individual)
Hospital_expenditure (previous hospital expenditure)
NUmber_of_past_hospitalizations (number of past hospitalizations)
Anual_Salary (annual salary of the individual)
region

Target Variable (Y):

charges (healthcare charges or insurance premiums)
Objective:
Develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate healthcare charges or insurance premiums for individuals based on their demographic, lifestyle, and medical characteristics. This model can assist insurance companies, healthcare providers, or policymakers in pricing insurance plans, assessing risk, and managing healthcare costs effectively.

With this problem statement, we have used  regression technique: linear regression  to build and evaluate predictive models based on the provided dataset.
